% stuff goes here

% talk about getting the frequency response of the filter (frequencyResponse.m)
% how the file works
% determining minimum frequency to meet < 2 dB atten for fund attentuation
% figuring out what cutoff works for required attentuation from filter (23 - 9.54 = 13.46)
% i'll put in some equations and plots for this later
% some discussion from the lab document

% generating square wave

% getting frequency response of square wave
% fft
% plotting magnitude spectrum
% plotting phase spectrum

% calculating output
% ifft stuff (2nd method discussed in lab)
% uh hope it actually works lol

%getting frequency response of output
